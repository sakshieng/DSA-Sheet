______Prefix Sum------


----------Kadane's Algorithm----------
we have to find the subarray which has maximum sum
sum+=a[i] <-- brute force 
maxi=max(sum,maxi)
if(sum<0) sum=0

for +ve no length of subarray=length of whole array

__________majority element moore's voting algorithm____________

if(cnt <= 0)
curr=a[i]
cnt=1
