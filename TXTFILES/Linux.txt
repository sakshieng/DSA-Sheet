We can develop analyse add new features improve the source code of software
-->Program is an executable file
they are stored on a disk or in secondary memory

-->A program under execution is a process
user starts a process thr terminal

Interface
|
|-->GUI
|-->CLI


Process consists:
|  stack  |
|         |
|  heap   |
|  data   |
|  text   |
|_________|


{
    A shell is a program that acts as an interface betn a user and the kernel
    A Kernel is interface betn application and hardware
    An OS is interface between user and hardware
}
Kernel
|-->monolithic
entire OS in a single work space(faster one)
|-->micro
core services of os run in one process while other services run in diff process (stable one)
|-->hybrid
combi of above 2 windows uses this

LINUX has:
(
the linux Kernel
additional software
package manager
software tools
)

web servers-->the platform where we search and get info 
Applications of LINUX
{
    super-computers like IBM's summit played part in covid vaccines
    ebook reader
    fitness tracker
    surveillance cameras
}

Mint is based on ubuntu lighter than linux
Fedora one of most user-friendly uses for IOT
Kali linux developed and maintained by offensive security based on Debian distro for penetration testing
Arch linux is a lightweigth it is a rolling release i.e. constantly  updating their versions

Linux system administrator
{
    it takes care of computers running on Linux OS
    integrity and security of services
}



pwd--> print working directory
cd-->change directory
ls--> list contents of current directory
flag will give 
ls -l-->
ls -a--> hidden files
ls -lh-->
mkdir-->make a directory
rmdir-->delete empty directory
rm--
touch is to modify timestamps which has 3 timestamps
{
-a flag for access -m for modification -d for change
}
cat-->used to create a file
history-->gives all old commands
nano-->
-E-->in cat
-a-->in cat
man-->display user manual of any command -->flags -f -w(use as man intro)
apropos-->find command if keyword is know -->flag -e(exact)(use as apropos intro)
grep-->find phrase within a file 
gio trash-->move file to trash(alternative for rm command)
wc-->
cat random
comm-->to compare to files(it requires file in sorted order)
by comm --nocheck a.txt b.txt we can directly get unique data

_____________Grp management commands ______________
we can remove grp which is not primary 
for grp and user commands sudo privileges are required


groupadd-->create group
groupdel-->delete group
useradd-->user is created
userdel-->user is deleted
gpasswd -a [username][groupname]-->add user to existing group
gpasswd -d [username][groupname]-->delte user from existing group
usermod -g [groupname][username]-->to change a user primary group
usermod -a -G [groupname][username]-->to change a user secondary group



_______File permission commands________
chown-->change file ownership
chmod-->(sudo chmod g+w [name of file]) we are changed permissions of file to like we added write 
        (sudo chmod a+x [name of file]) a for all got x
risky command-->chmod 777
                rwx|rwx|rwx
                owner|group|others

ctrl+a start ctrl+e at end ctrl+w delete word ctrl+l clear terminal ctrl+q used to clear line
!! previous command gets repeated

____________Process Management in Linux____________
ps -aux-->aux means all users process
pstree-->command for printing process tree
when u boot the pc the first process that starts is 
process exist in parent-child hierarchies 

process started by pc is demon

PID unique id
%CPU cpu usage
2 types of process-->
foreground --dependent process which require user to interact with
(like sleep 90 --> make bash sleep for 90 sec)
background
(like sleep 90 &)

process Management means manipulating the process i.e. kill resume 
->kill -l
-->htop
bg-->(bg jobID)
ping-->connection 
pidof-->
after ps there are numbers display called as no
kill-->(like kill -9 no)
touch-->create simple file
cat >
cat >>
cp-->copy file
mv-->rename a file(directory) or move a directory


_______PIPELINING IN LINUX_______
sort -r-->will sort in reverse order
gedit-->create a file if 
for seeing contents of file use cat
(
Connecting data flow from one process to another. Output of one command is given to input for second command, this is done through pipe '|'.
)
ps -u[username] | grepm

grep -u maria | "bash"

cat [filename] | sort-->original file will not modify

cat 1.txt | grep "hi"

________File system and management_________
-->Inode
-->file permission
-->advanced file management commands

directory--collection of files it is organization of structures

File system-->to recognize data by ur pc it controls data
Formatting-->process of writing a file system to the disk and preparing it for file operation

{
    There are few common abstractions that are used in filesystem:
    -->superblock
    -->file
    -->inode
    -->dentry
}

bits-->sections-->memory blocks
deleting --> means iterate thr data and delete each and every bit

boot section-->what kind of data it holda in section

1 byte=8 bits           1 kb=1000 bits

Types of file system:
Ext4    BtrFS   Fat32   XFS   NTFS   ZFS
default memory size of boot section:4 kb

Inodes-->addressing for memory block
Inode bitmap-->It just occupies one block and is a sequence of 0s and 1s

{
    The bitmap technique is useful to quickly find free locations on the inode table (or data blocks) when modifying the filesystem.
}

if our system has 1MByte of data then it is fragmented in 4kb boot sections 
Ext4-->extended 4-->upto what extent we can continuously allocate data

Ext4DFS is online defragmentation tool for XFS file system it is [xfs_fsr]
disk corruption-->link breaks and data integrity collapses
allocation group-->

file system used in servers-->ZFS(ZettaByte) 1 ZiB=1000EiB
one feature of ZFS is transactional semantics   CheckSums   Built-in Scrub(checks chances of correction)  Single F.S. snapshot(it stores the state of disc)

BtrFS uses 3 algorithms-->1.ZLIB
                          2.LZO
                          3.LSTD
this is for transparent file compression
here there is privilege of open source hence we can convert EXT->BtrFS 
Android is based on base-linux EXT4 FS
SSD supports all memory files
Pendrive uses EXFAT FS

{
    kernel establishes a temporary root file-system using initrd(initial RAM disk) 
    Restart button or CTRL+ALT+DELETE keys are used for warm boot
}

____________Linux directory structure__________
the process that runs on PC is demon
cdrom-->comapct disc -->external floppy discs
command line tools-->nmap(python)
when pendrive is connected to pc it is mounted(means recognize the data)
each process is converted to file in linux to maintain the transparency
sbin-->system bin-->for super user
external services system needs-->printers routers mouse anti-virus
sys-->direcly access kernel system
usr-->universal 
when we take backup that cashes are stored in var directory 
to see hidden file-->ctrl+h
in desktop directories are stored like .gnome as these are configuration directory


______Users in Linux_________
Types of users

{
    Regular-->has Moderate privilege it owns a home directory 
    System-->Has highest privilege 
}
Super user-->Known as root users has access to everything on server 

Sudo is master key to ur high privilege admin tasks 
sudo has high privilege collection of zero or more users

Types of grps (grps-->collection of zero or more users)
Primary->
Each user must belong to one primary grp
Secondary->
a user can be a member of zero or more secondary grps

command for system users-->cat /etc/passwd

|   |   |   |   |   |   |
File permission-->chown and chargp commands
3 types of permissions:
Read 
Write
Execute(shell scripts are file which are executable)

_____Defragmentation____

If you actually need to defragment a file system, the simplest way is probably the most reliable: Copy all the files off the partition, erase the files from the partition, then copy the files back onto the partition. The file system will intelligently allocate the files as you copy them back onto the disk.

fsck-->
    You can measure the fragmentation of a Linux file system look for “non-contiguous inodes” in the output

Defragmenting is an intensive process that moves the bits of files around to reduce fragmentation, ensuring each file is contiguous on the drive

______Booting Process______
{
    6 stages of booting:
    -->BIOS
    -->MBR(master boot record)
    -->GRUB(grand unified bootloader)
    -->Kernel(mounts root file system in grub.conf file)
    -->Init
    -->Runlevel programs
}

{
        in INIT process system looks for an init file,usually found at /etc/inittab to deide run level 
        7 run levels
        -->3-multi-user mode(network support)
        -->5-graphical X11(GUI)
}

_______Types of booting__________
Cold booting -->starting a computer which was switched off involves Power on Self Test(POST)

Warm booting -->Restarting a computer without interrupting power doesn't involve POST

Types of editors-->
GEDIT-->GUI based text editor default text editor for GNOME 
NANO-->Terminal based text editor 
VI/VIM-->Terminal based text editor most used editor
_________
i-insert mode
Esc-command mode
:q!-quit without saving
:w-save file but don't exit
:wq-to write,save and exit

{
    -->a red-black tree is self-balancing binary search tree
    -->a BST is an ordered/sorted binary tree
    -->the time complexity of operations on the binary search tree is directly proportional to the height of the tree
    -->BSTs are also a fundamental DS used in construction of abstract data structures as sets,multisets and associative arrays
}




{
variables can be any type
print("you are"+str(age) +"yars old,sep=",")
print("you are",age ,"yars old)
print("you are {age} yars old)

format specifiers
.(no)f -precision roundoff
.(no)- allocate that spaces
03 - zero pad that spaces
< -left align
> - right align
^ -centre align
+ -indicate positive value
= place sign to left position
  - space before positive numbers
, -seperator

The None keyword is used to define a null value, or no value at all.
None is not the same as 0, False, or an empty string. 
None is a data type of its own (NoneType).

In Python 3, there is effectively no limit to how long an integer value can be. 

Complex numbers are specified as <real part>+<imaginary part>j.

binary octa hexa

Type Casting(explicit ,implicit)

Input taking
input("enter :")

pop -random

s=frozenset(s)
non modifiable

Tuple-() Ordered And  Unchangeable ,Duplicates Ok . FASTER
indexing

print(dir(list))

operators 

if -else if
ternary technique:
`	print("a") if a>b else print("b")

.update(new key:value) -unique keys
.clear
.popitem -remove latest pair
del dic["name"]
