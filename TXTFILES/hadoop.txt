1)What is Hadoop ?

Apache based open source framework and is implemented in java
it is not centred storage but is ditiubuted
HDFS takes cared of distributed storage (Hadoop Distributed File System)
Distributed processing of Big Data is done by || Map Reduce ||
It is a Apache based open source framework implemented in java having Distributed Storage(HDFS) and Distributed processing (Map Reduce) for processing Big Data which supports Simple Programming Model, Parallel Processing and local computation & Storage.


Simple Programming Model :: Model which maintains simplicity
Parallel Processing :: serial processing goes way slower
Local Computation and storage :: every node caries out local Computation

2)Architecture of Hadoop
 ___________________
|    Map Reduce     | => Distributed Processing   
|                   |
|       HDFS        | => Distributed Storage
|                   |
|      Common       | => java modules files and scripts required 
|     utilities     |    by hadoop modules to work
|                   |
|   YARN Framework  | => Yet Another Resource Negotiator (JS and RM)
|___________________|    Job Scheduling and Resource Management


|| MAP REDUCE ||

based on yarn framework works for distributed processing and Parallel processing


            |-- map()\
            |         \ 
INPUT ------|-- map() - reduce()\
            |                    (())-> OUTPUT
            |-- map() - reduce()/

map() takes one form of set of data and converts to another form of set of data which is in the form of tuples (key value pair)
reduce() combines the key value pair on basis of the keys and forms set of tuples

1)master job cracker ::(one)
    manages resources
    Scheduling tasks
    monitoring the tasks

2)Slave task tracker ::(many)
    Executes the tasks  
    provides task status


|| HDFS ||

Name node && Data node
(Master)       (Slave)
data about the data ===> Meta data

meta data is managed by Name node and it manages data node

Block :: a file is devided into many segments called Block
64mb size capacity of a data node

How Hadoop works ??

client has to give input and output locations
job specifications

          H
 data ->  D --------> MAP REDUCE
 prgm ->  F              /   \
          S           Master Slave

master devides the task into smaller task and distributes it to Slave
and slave Executes the task & reports to master periodically
when task is completly done by slaves then data is stored in data nodes


|| Advantages                           || Disadvantages

1)High computing power                  1)Not fit for small data
2)Storage                               2)Security concerns
3)Fault tolerance                       3)Prg. model is restrictive
4)Flexibility(in terms of data)         4)Joins of multiple datasets in complex and slow
5)Scalability           
6)Low Cost(Open source)



|| Hadoop Ecosystem ||

It's not a programming language or a service provider
It's a platform/framework used to solve big data problem

It comprises of hadoop components
1)HDFS
2)yarn
3)map reduce
4)Apache Pig
5)Apache Hive
6)Mahout

((())) Apache Hive ((())) 
It is an open source warehouse system for quering and analysing large data set stored in H.files:Hive uses HQL as a language
It is a distributed, fault-tolerant data warehouse system that enables analytics at a massive scale. A data warehouse provides a central store of information that can easily be analyzed to make informed, data driven decisions. Hive allows users to read, write, and manage petabytes of data using SQL.

Data summarization,query, analysis

uses HiveQl ==> HQL [ Hive + SQL]
Highly Scalable

        sql commands          converts
user ----------------> Hive-------------> Master(hadoop cluster)
          submit        |     sql to map
                        |     reduce job
                       \|/
                    metaStore
{
    the created jobs are given to Hadoop cluster(masters+slave) as a input
}

|| Apache Pig ||

It uses Pig Latin language for execution purpose and requires java runtime environment(JRE)

Steps ::
    1) User Defined Files present in Local File System
    2)Those UDF are converted into pig script
    3)pig script is passed to pig latin compiler
    {
        pig latin complier converts pig script into map reduce jobs
    }
    4)I/P files in HDFS are passed to pig latin compiler
    5)Execution of map reduce jobs
    6)O/P files are stored in HDFS
    
Developers had to care about map, the reduce fundamentals sort shuffle while creating a program for which they needed common operations such as joining, filtering and etc. These chanllenges kept on building up whicle optimizing and extending the code.
you guys might already know how much of a work it is to optimize something to it's best.
so production time increased, and data flow in mapReduce was quite rigid, out out of one task could be input as other.
so pig was developed by yahoo in 2006
pig is a query based language same as sql
pig take cares of the map reduce and processed data is stored in HDFS
pig language runs on pig environment such as java run on jvm.
Pig helps to achieve ease of programming and optimization and hence is a major segment of the Hadoop Ecosystem.

COMPONENTS OF PIG

1)Pig latin language --> comprises of commands and syntax
2)Pig runtime --> The runtime engine is a compiler that produces sequences of MapReduce programs

Stages of pig operations

stage 1: Load data and write pig script
In this stage, data is loaded and Pig script is written.

stage 2: Pig operations
in the second stage, the Pig execution engine Parses and checks the script. If it passes the script optimized and a logical and physical plan is generated for execution.

stage 3: Execution of the plan
In the final stage, results are dumped on the section or stored in HDFS depending on the user command.

Data model in pig

()  Atom : atomic value like int , long , double ,string
()  Tuple : sequences of field and can be of any data type
()  Bag : It is a collection of tuples of potentially varying structures and can contain duplicates.
()  maps : It is an associative array.
In maps key should be of char type and value can be any

Pig Execution modes

1)Local mode : In the local mode, the Pig engine takes input from the Linux file system and the output is stored in same
2)Mapreduce system : in MapReduce mode, the Pig engine directly interacts and executes in HDFS and MapReduce

|| Apache HBase ||

It is a noSQL distributed database system
Data is stored in tabular form in no structured SQL
{
    data definition language-->is performed by region servers which are reactive in nature 
}
{
the clients are connected with region servers and this relation is maintained by Zookeepers(load balancing and synchronization is done by them)
}
{
    data manipulation language-->
}
the region servers are connected with data nodes in HDFS
