Backend -> Server Side Rendering

# NOTE : Remember Backend is not about coding or implementing features i.e just a part of it, Actually Backend is learning about  Architecture of it and How it Works !!!

Components Of Backend :

1. Proxy -> Requests ko Collect karne ka kaam karta hai
2. Load Balancer -> Request Kounse Server Pe Jaayega, wo decide karne ka kaam karta hai
3. Web Server
4. Cache
5. Database

{
    System Design is  process of designing  architecture, components, and interfaces for a system so that it meets  end-user requirements
}
ACID Properties (SQL)
1. A - Atomicity -> All Or None
2. C - Consistent -> Data Sahi Form me store hona chahiye (i.e Number me Name store nahi hone chahiye)
3. I - Isolation -> All Transactions should be Isolated
4. D - Durability -> Jo paryant mi punha modify naahi karto, data change naahi hoyala paahije

BASE Properties (NoSQL) -> 
1.Basically Available
2.Soft State
3.Eventual consistency

CAP Thoereom (Universal)
1. C -> Consistency -> Fees Bharne pe turant refresh kiya, fees not paid dikhata hai, 10-15 seconds ke baad karne pe Fees paid dikhata hai !
2. A -> Availability -> Suppose ek database band pad gaya, uske badle dusra database connect karne me jitna time lagta hai utne time server unavailable hota hai
3. P -> Partition Tolerance -> Bahut bada data hota hai, usko partition karte hai (logically partition karte hai) 

# Note : SQL Database madhe Partition Tolerance Kami Aste
         MongoDB Consistency Follow Karto
         MongoDB me single master hai, so Availability nahi
         MongoDB madhe Partition Tolerance Aste

*** Cassandra -> Available + Partition
*** MongoDB -> Consistent + Partition


# Note : Jaha Cluster hoga, waha consistency nahi hoti (Matlab waha time lagega hi) because database replicate karne me time lagega hi, jab tak replicate nahi hoga tab tak inconsistent

# MongoDB Structure
Master -> Many Slaves
Master Band Padla Tar -> Baaki Slaves me election hoga, koun master banega

# Note : Partitions aur Join saath me use nahi karte


VPN -> Reverse Proxy -> Hamara IP leta hai and hamare behalf pe Internet pe apna IP bhejta hai
e.g Sophos -> Firewall


# Mongo vs Cassandra
Mongo me ek hi master hota hai, wohi dadagiri karta hai, if wo band pad jaayega others will fight for who will do Dadagiri -> Eventual Availability

Cassandra me sab friends hi tarah rehte hai, to usme saara data sabke pass rehta, but wo data batane me time lagta hai so Eventual Consistency Hoti Hai


-> Kounsa Database use karaycha te use case var aste
-> Archive jaisi cheezo ke liye kam servers rakhte hai
-> Feeds ke liye bahut servers lagte hai
-> Jo latest data ho wo cache me rakho for faster retrieval


{
    Global declaration of vector will give 0 value to all
}

-> Archive ko alag server do, Feed ko alag server dete hai industry me unlike what we do generally in our projects

# MicroServices
Chote Chote Applications banate hai and unko merge karke ek badi application Banayi jaati hai (Most Trending Nowadays)

Why? => Scaling, agar kisi cheez ko kam requests aati hai to usko alag rakho taaki usko scale karne ki jarurat na pade

Also alag alag components alag alag ho sakte hai matlab koi critical hoga, koi non-critical hoga agar unko seperate karde to alag alag type ka databse use kar sakte hai !


# Cache -> RAM (Main Memory) of Server me store hota hai
-> Faster Access ke liye
-> Ek aadhi ghost aamhala immediate pahije tar te cache madhe store karnar
-> e.g Rank of first 10 students
-> Cache can affect consistency
-> Cache ek fix time ke liye rehta hai, so suppose wo 10 second ke liye fix tha, us 10 second me top 10 me koi naya add hogaya toh hame wrong list dikhegi kyunki cache update 10 second baad hoga
-> Obviously, we can design such system where agar list me change ho toh cache refresh ho jaaye

-> Agar multiple servers ho to unka cache agar alag alag hoga, to uska cache inconsistent ho jaayega, so iske liye what we can do we make a different cache server

-> Agar saare servers ke cache alag alag ho, to us case me we use something called as sticky session, means load balancer make sure ki meri request ushi server pe jaaye. Kisi aur server pe naa jaaye !!!

-->Load balancing refers to efficiently distributing incoming network traffic across a group of backend servers, also known as a server farm or server pool.

A library is a collection of prewritten code that can be used to simplify tasks
These are found to be focused on narrow scopes such as strings, sockets, and IO
So thier APIs are also small and require fewer dependencies. Example-->jQuery, NumPy
The library can be invoked whenever and wherever you like

                    Ur code
        /                       \
       /                         \   
       Ur called library        Framework call u
       |                            |
       |                            |
       library        contains   <----Framework
       
 interpreter <-- shebang

 env-->list of environment variables
 $ --> variable trat
 $BASH-->bash cha path
 $BASH_version-->version of bash


buy bigger machines → vertical scaling

buy more machines → horizontal scaling

browser side js :-> DOM features like queryselector Window Interactive apps No filesystem Fragmentation ES6 modules

Node.js :->

It is runtime environment
Framework(a set of tools which guides us to to develop a piece of code) like Express uses Node runtime environment No DOM No geolocation No window objects Server side apps Filesysytem version MVC architecture CommonJS,every file is module(by module) only logic without graphical interface

Intro to Node.js and Express.js
->modules means encapsulated code(only share minimum) some built-in modules are-> OS Path FileSystem HTTP

{
 
Common server responses:
200 OK -
 request was successful (some API calls may return 201 instead).

204 No Content -
 request was successful but there is no representation to return (i.e.  response is empty).

401 Unauthorized -
authentication failed or user doesn't have permissions for requested operation.

403 Forbidden -
access denied.

404 Not Found -
resource was not found.

422 Unprocessable Entity -
requested data contain invalid values.

->All requests must be sent over HTTPS protocol<- } { -->Express application can use  following types of middleware:

1.Application-level middleware 2.Router-level middleware 3.Error-handling middleware 4.Built-in middleware 5.Third-party middleware

<-------------------The ultimate git cheatsheet--------------->

git init->initializing an existing directory as a Git repository

git clone[repo_url]->clone(download) a repository that already exists on github

git remote add origin[url]->after using git init,link local repo to an empty git repo 

git config --global user.name"[firstname lastname]"-->set a username

git config --global user.email"[firstname lastname]"-->set an email address

git branch-->to check which branch it is

git branch [branch-name]->create a new branch

git checkout -b [branch-name]->creates new branch and switch to that branch using only one command

git branch -d [branch-name]->deletes  specified branch

----for stage and snapshot----

git status-->show modified files in working directory,staged for ur next commit

git add[file_name]-->add a file as it looks now to ur next commit(stage)

git add-->add all changed files to staging area

git commit -m"[descriptive message]"-->commit ur staged content as a new commit snapshot

git pull origin <branch_name> --> updates ur current local working branch with all new commits from corres. remote branch on github
{
    git pull is combi of git fetch and git merge
    .gitignore -> It helps you enforce policy around which files should be excluded from version control
}

git push origin <branch_name> -->updates all local branch commits to github

git fetch-->synchronize ur local repo with remote repo on github.comb

{
    Sometimes it may be a good idea to exclude files from being tracked with git.This is typically done in special file named .gitignore

    secret scanning --> Looks for known secrets or credentials committed within repository
}
git blame --> displays commit history for a file

git clone --bare repo_url -->  creates a full copy of  data,but without a working directory for editing files, and ensures a clean, fresh export of all old data

git push mirror rpo_url -->  which ensures that all references, such as branches and tags, are copied to the imported repository

git remote -v --> Verifies the new remote URL
----Redo Commands----

git reset-->reset staging area to match most recent commit,but leave working directory unchanged

git reset --hard-->reset staging area and working most recent commit & overwrites all changes in working directory

git revert <commit> -->create a new commit that undoes all of changes made i,then apply it to current branch

----Temporary Commands----

git stash-->put current changes from ur working directory into stash for later use

git stash pop-->apply stored stash content into working directory and clears stash

git stash drop-->delete a specific stash from all ur previous stashes

{
    different stauses of pull requests ->
    Draft pull request
    open pull request
    closed pull request
    merged pull request
}

{
    IP PATTERN
    String pattern = 
        "^([01]?\\d\\d?|2[0-4]\\d|25[0-5])\\." +
        "([01]?\\d\\d?|2[0-4]\\d|25[0-5])\\." +
        "([01]?\\d\\d?|2[0-4]\\d|25[0-5])\\." +
        "([01]?\\d\\d?|2[0-4]\\d|25[0-5])$";
