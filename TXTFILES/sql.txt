  SQL is basically the language that the user use to communicate with the Databases and get our required interpretation of data out of it


  Used for
  -->storing data
  -->retrieving data
  -->manipulating data out of DB

To get started with SQL we need to install Database Management System server
Some common RDBMS(will provide all required tools to perform opn on DB):
-->Oracle
-->MySQL
-->PostgreSQL
-->Heidi SQL

It has well-structured standards,easy to learn,one can create multiple views using SQL,SQl queries are portable in nature


  Types of commands in SQL:
  -->DDL-data definition language
  [
    1.create
    2.alter
    3.drop( Used to delete the structure and record stored in the table)
    4.truncate(Used to delete all the rows from the table, and free up the space in the table)
  ]
  -->DML-data manipulation language(maintenance)
  [
    1.insert
    2.update
    3.delete(Used to delete one or more rows in a table)
  ]
  -->TCL-transaction control language
  [
    1.commit(saves all transaction made on db)
    2.rollback(it is used to undo transaction which are not yet been saved)
  ]
  -->DCL-data control language
  [
    1.grant(Used to grant a user access privileges to db)
    2.revoke(Used to revoke the permissions from an user)
    3.savepoint(Used to roll transaction back to a certain point without having to roll back the entirity of the transaction)
  ]
  -->DQL-data query language
  [
    1.select( It is used to retrieve selected data based on some conditions which are described using the WHERE clause)
  ]
}
{
  SQL Constraints(are rules which are applied on a table)------

  1.not null-->Specifies that this column cannot store a NULL value
  
  2.unique-->Specifies that this column can have only Unique values, i.e the values cannot be repeated in the column

  3.Primary Key--> It is a field using which it is possible to uniquely identify each row in a table.

  4.Foreign Key--> It is a field using which it is possible to uniquely identify each row in some other table. 
  [
    It is used to maintain referntial integrity,it is used to cross link 2 tables together
  ]

  5.check--> It validates if all values in a column satisfy some particular condition or not

  6.default--> It specifies a default value for a column when no value is specified for that field
}
{
  SQL Opeartors
  -->Arithmetic
  -->Comparison
  -->Logical
  -->Bitwise
  -->Relational
  -->Compound
}
{
  Clauses-->
  1.order by:It is the keyword used to sort result in asending or descending order

  2.group by:It groups rows that have the same values into summary rows,used with aggregate func

  3.having:It was added 'where' keyword cannot be used with aggregate func

  4.join:It is used to used to combine rows from 2 or more tables
}
{
  SQLi is a vunerability that lets a malicious hacker introduce(inject) undesired SQL code into SQL queries executed by SW.
}
{
  Joins in SQL-----
  Joins allows us to fetch data after combining multiple tables of db

  1.Inner join=>returns any records which have matching values in both tables

  2.Natural join=>it is special type of inner join based on fact that column names and datatypes are same on both tables

  3.Right join=>returns all of records from second table,along with any matching records from the first

  4.Left join=>returns all of records from first table,along with any matching records from the second

  5.Full join=>returns all records from both tables when there is match
}
{
  Exception handling in C++
  try:represent a block of code that can throw an Exception
  catch:represent a block of code that get executed when error is thrown
  throw:used to throw an Exception
}
[
  -->Inline func:it is a func that is expanded in line when it is called
  -->C++ has 52 keywords
  -->Friend class can access the private and protected members of other class in which it is declared as friend
  -->every object in C++ has access to its own address through pointer called 'this' pointer
  -->Friend func doesn't have this pointer
  -->'new' is dynamic memory allocator
]
[
  packet sniffer->a passive receiver that records a copy of every packet that files by 
  There are sw which are specially deployed for packet-sniffing
  IP snoofing->the ability to inject pkts into internet with false source address
