There are several algorithms in DS few of them are:
1.Brute force
2.Recursive
3.Divide & Conquer
4.Backtracking
5.Searching
6.Sorting
7.Hashing
8.Greedy
9.Dynamic Programming
10.Randomized
{
int main(){
    int n = 100;
    int *p = &n;
    int &m = *p;
    cout<<n<<m<<*p;
    int k=5;
    p=&k;
    k=200;
    cout<<n<<m<<*p;
    return 0;
}
}
x!=0
if(x)

x==0
if(!x)

-->An important concept in sorting is inversions. 


-->An inversion in a sequence is defined as a pair of elements that are out of order with respect to the ordering relation


-->A sorting algorithm is a sequence of operations that reduces inversions to 0.


-->The Web 3.0 also referred as Semantic Web or read-write-execute is the era(2010 and above) which refers to the future of web. 


-->Subarray question approach:
    sliding window
    2-pointer
    prefix sum array
    Greedy algorithm
    recursion

Special algo-->Tortoise algorithm

Stacks -->appl^n is parsing it is any logic that breaks data into independent pieces for further processing 

Stack	                                Heap
:Stack is a linear data structure.    :Heap is a hierarchical data structure.

______CROW________
A Fast and Easy to use microframework for the web.
Crow is a C++ framework for creating HTTP or Websocket web services. It uses routing similar to Python's Flask which makes it easy to use. It is also extremely fast, beating multiple existing C++ frameworks as well as non C++ frameworks.

In computing, an emulator is hardware or software that enables one computer system (called the host) to behave like another computer system (called the guest).


{
  Defragmentation is often done to improve computer performance.It is the process of moving clusters as close together as possible in order to speed the system up. This procedure involves moving data from one location on the drive to another. As such, data can be overwritten in the process. These overwritten (destroyed) data may have had some 
  evidentiary value.

TYPES OF META-DATA-->
1.Descriptive metadata
2.Structural metadata

Throughput is basically equivalent to digital bandwidth consumption; it can be calculated mathematically using the queueing theory, where the load in packets per time unit is represented by the arrival rate, and the throughput is marked by the departure rate.
Throughput is dependent on latency-->rate*time
A glossary is a collection of words pertaining to a specific topic. Are always in alphabetical order.
A glossary is used to ensure that all stakeholders (business and technical) understand what is meant by the terminology, acronyms, and phrases used inside an organization.

Github uses Linked list and trees as its data structure

The data type modifiers are listed here -->signed -->unsigned -->long -->short

Type Qualifiers in C++ -->const -->volatile -->restrict

_____________________DBMS_______________________

Database--> A database is a collection of related data which represents some aspects of real world

DBMS-->It is a software for retrieving and storing user's data while considering appropriate security measures.

Types of database languages:
1.Data definition language
2.Data manipulation language
3.Data control language
4.Transaction control language

Types of DBMS:
.Hierarchical
.Network
.Relational
.Object-oriented

Users of DBMS can be categorized as:
-->Administrators(maintain the DBMS & are responsible for administrating database)
-->Designers(are grp of people who actually work on designing part of database)
-->Endusers(are those who actually reap the benefits of DBMS)

Data Abstraction refers to the process of hiding irrelevant details from the user. , Three levels there - View Level, Conceptual Level, and Physical Level
Data redundancy is present in files
When we import foreign key then it is primary key for another

Every node is connecetd to every other node
1 node -> n-1 ports
n node -> n(n-1) ports
total number of linkes = n(n-1)/2 = no.of Ports/2
||Mesh Topology||

Every node is connecetd to every other node
1 node -> n-1 ports
n node -> n(n-1) ports
total number of linkes = n(n-1)/2 = no.of Ports/2

Advantages:
1)Robust
2)Fault diagnosis easy
3)provides security and privacy

Disadvantes:
1)Installation and configoration -> complicated
2)Cost of wiring is high , and bulk is required hence suitable for less devices
3)High cost of maintenance

|| Star Topology ||

All devices are connecetd to a single HUB--> central node
 central HUB
 |
 |- active hub => intelligent
 |- passive hub => not intelligent => broadcasting devices

 Advantages:
 1)N devices requires N cables
 1)Each device requires only 1 port;i.e connecetd to central HUB
 3)is Robust
 4)easy Fault diagnosis and Fault isolation


 Disadvantes:
 1)central hub fail jhala --> crashes the Topology
 2)The cost of Installation is very high
 3)Performance is beased on single concentrated i.e HUB

 || Bus Topology ||

 Every device is conneceted to a single cable.
 It uni-directional data transfer method
 Non-robust Topology -> if backbone fails, whole Topology crashes

Advantages:
1) 1 cable for n devices , n drop lines
2) Low cost of the cable and is used to build small networks

Disadvantes:
1)if the Common cable fails, the Topology gets crashed
2)if the network traffic is heavy the amount of collisions rises.
3)Low security

{
Manchester code (also known as phase encoding
-->It is a self-clocking signal with no DC component
}
Low pass channel or medium with the bandwidth that starts from zero.

Band pass channel has the bandwidth that does not start from zero.
