//Bit manipulation
• __builtin_clz(x): number of zeros at beginning of bit representation
• __builtin_ctz(x): number of zeros at end of bit representation
• __builtin_popcount(x): number of ones in bit representation
• __builtin_parity(x): parity (even or odd) of number of ones in
bit representation

-->An important concept in sorting is inversions. 


-->An inversion in a sequence is defined as a pair of elements that are out of order with respect to ordering relation


-->A sorting algorithm is a sequence of operations that reduces inversions to 0.

______CROW________
A Fast and Easy to use microframework for web.
Crow is a C++ framework for creating HTTP or Websocket web services. It uses routing similar to Python's Flask which makes it easy to use. It is also extremely fast, beating multiple existing C++ frameworks as well as non C++ frameworks.

In computing, an emulator is hardware or software that enables one computer system (called host) to behave like another computer system (called guest).


{
  Defragmentation is often done to improve computer performance.It is process of moving clusters as close together as possible in order to speed system up. This procedure involves moving data from one location on drive to another. As such, data can be overwritten in process. These overwritten (destroyed) data may have had some 
  evidentiary value.

Cryptography is study of secure communications techniques that allow only sender and intended recipient of a message to view its contents

Metadata is data that provides information about other data
TYPES OF META-DATA-->
1.Descriptive metadata
2.Structural metadata
3.Administrative metadata
4.Reference metadata

Throughput is basically equivalent to digital bandwidth consumption; it can be calculated mathematically using queueing theory, where load in packets per time unit is represented by arrival rate, and throughput is marked by departure rate.
Throughput is dependent on latency-->rate*time
A glossary is a collection of words pertaining to a specific topic. Are always in alphabetical order.
A glossary is used to ensure that all stakeholders (business and technical) understand what is meant by terminology, acronyms, and phrases used inside an organization.

_____________________DBMS_______________________

Database--> A database is a collection of related data which represents some aspects of real world

DBMS-->It is a software for retrieving and storing user's data while considering appropriate security measures.

Types of database languages:
1.Data definition language
2.Data manipulation language
3.Data control language
4.Transaction control language

Types of DBMS:
.Hierarchical
.Network
.Relational
.Object-oriented

Users of DBMS can be categorized as:
-->Administrators(maintain DBMS & are responsible for administrating database)
-->Designers(are grp of people who actually work on designing part of database)
-->Endusers(are those who actually reap benefits of DBMS)

Data Abstraction refers to process of hiding irrelevant details from user. , Three levels there - View Level, Conceptual Level, and Physical Level
Data redundancy is present in files
When we import foreign key then it is primary key for another

Every node is connecetd to every other node
1 node -> n-1 ports
n node -> n(n-1) ports
total number of linkes = n(n-1)/2 = no.of Ports/2
||Mesh Topology||

Every node is connecetd to every other node
1 node -> n-1 ports
n node -> n(n-1) ports
total number of linkes = n(n-1)/2 = no.of Ports/2

Advantages:
1)Robust
2)Fault diagnosis easy
3)provides security and privacy

Disadvantes:
1)Installation and configoration -> complicated
2)Cost of wiring is high , and bulk is required hence suitable for less devices
3)High cost of maintenance

|| Star Topology ||

All devices are connecetd to a single HUB--> central node
 central HUB
 |
 |- active hub => intelligent
 |- passive hub => not intelligent => broadcasting devices

 Advantages:
 1)N devices requires N cables
 1)Each device requires only 1 port;i.e connecetd to central HUB
 3)is Robust
 4)easy Fault diagnosis and Fault isolation


 Disadvantes:
 1)central hub fail jhala --> crashes Topology
 2)The cost of Installation is very high
 3)Performance is beased on single concentrated i.e HUB

 || Bus Topology ||

 Every device is conneceted to a single cable.
 It uni-directional data transfer method
 Non-robust Topology -> if backbone fails, whole Topology crashes

Advantages:
1) 1 cable for n devices , n drop lines
2) Low cost of cable and is used to build small networks

Disadvantes:
1)if Common cable fails, Topology gets crashed
2)if network traffic is heavy amount of collisions rises.
3)Low security

Manchester code (also known as phase encoding
-->It is a self-clocking signal with no DC component

Low pass channel or medium with bandwidth that starts from zero.

Band pass channel has bandwidth that does not start from zero.
