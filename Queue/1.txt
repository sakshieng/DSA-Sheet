FIFO-->queue

1 0 5 6 5 
_______________

rear side-->aat yenar
front side-->baher padnar
enqueue-->push queue
deque-->pop quque

priority queue(heap)
|-->max heap-->motha vr
|-->min heap-->lahan vr


-M%N=(N-M)%N

Recursion takes auxiliary space hence iterative approach is best

for priority queue refer to trees folder heap
